Students with
Disabilities:
Opportunities and
Challenges for
Colleges and
Universities
Barbara A. Lee
One of the signature human rights achievements of the twentieth
century—which occurred near its close—was the expansion of rights of
individuals with disabilities (or rather, as some would remind us, the
decrease in discrimination against such individuals). When the Education for
All Handicapped Children law was enacted in 1975, children attending public
schools gained the right to accommodations and an education in the “least
restrictive environment” possible. That law became the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1990, which expanded children's rights
to a public education that addressed their special needs.
The generation of children who, whether effectively or not, were
accommodated in US public schools is now in college, and some are posing
challenges for which some institutions are unprepared. Working with
students with disabilities has become far more complex than simply ensuring
that they receive classroom accommodations such as interpreters or extra
time on tests. For example, the widespread adoption of digital technology for
instruction (including digital e-readers instead of books) has made it difficult
for some visually impaired students to fully participate in their academic
programs.
The universal symbol of disability—found on parking spaces, restrooms, and
doors of public buildings—is the wheelchair, yet most college students with
disabilities do not have physical disorders. Improved understanding and
diagnosis of mental illness has opened the opportunity for a college
education to students who a generation ago might have either been unable
to attend college or who would have faced hurdles to college completion.
Few college leaders of the twentieth century, for instance, would have
contemplated, much less sanctioned, the presence of animals—except,
perhaps, for guide dogs for blind students—in residence halls, classrooms,
or student centers to accommodate such students.
Data collected by the US Department of Education in 2008 indicate that US
colleges and universities enrolled 707,000 students with disabilities, divided
roughly equally between public and private institutions. The survey found
that 31 percent of these students reported learning disabilities, 18 percent
ADD or ADHD, 15 percent mental illness or psychiatric conditions, and 11
percent other types of health impairment (Raue and Lewis, 2011, p. 3). The
sheer number of students with disabilities suggests that most, if not all,
colleges and universities are dealing with the need to accommodate some of
their students.
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 has required “reasonable and
effective accommodations” for students with disabilities in any educational
institution receiving federal funds (including financial aid) for several
decades. But the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
(ADA) heightened public interest in the issues faced by individuals with
disabilities in education, employment, and access to public accommodations.
And it stimulated considerable litigation.
Students who believe that they have encountered discrimination by a college
or university have two choices: They may file an administrative complaint
with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (for claims
under both Section 504 and the ADA), or they may file a private lawsuit
against the college. Administrative charges and lawsuits alleging disability
discrimination skyrocketed in the first decade of the twenty-first century.
Although colleges prevail in most (but by no means all) of these lawsuits, the
extent and frequency of litigation have not abated.
Students with disabilities are generally savvy about their rights and expect to
be accommodated just as they were in K–12 education, but they may not be
used to the independence of college and may have difficulty in managing the
college experience. Many colleges and universities have special offices that
deal with the needs of these students and manage the accommodation
process.
But in recent years, even those institutions with experienced staff and
dedicated offices have faced new and complex challenges. Litigation
involving students with disabilities has increasingly focused on four issues
that are difficult to resolve for both educational and logistical reasons.
1
.
Visually impaired students have challenged the use of e-readers and other
digital hardware that may not be fully accessible to students who cannot
read text.
2
.
Some students with psychiatric disorders have requested that they be
permitted to bring a “comfort animal” to campus and perhaps even to class.
3
.
The US government has imposed stricter requirements on colleges that
wish to exclude students who may be a danger to themselves.
4
.
And students with disabilities enrolled in graduate programs with a clinical
component who have excelled in traditional classroom-based learning but
have difficulties with hands-on clinical education have become more likely
to challenge their dismissals from these programs.
E-Learning and Visual Impairments
Under Titles II and III of the ADA, public colleges, and private colleges that
are “places of public accommodation,” must modify their policies and
practices to accommodate the documented disabilities of a student. At the
same time, the widespread adoption of Web-based instructional technology
has enabled faculty to provide students with course readings and other
resources that can be downloaded from the course Website or the Internet.
But students with visual impairments may not be able to access these
course materials.
The American Federation for the Blind has been on the forefront of filing
complaints against colleges and universities whose digital instructional
platforms or required e-learning devices have been difficult for visually
impaired students to use. For example, in 2010 the Federation filed a federal
discrimination complaint with the US Department of Justice (which enforces
Titles II and III of the ADA) against Penn State University, claiming that the
university's course-management software, library catalog, and the various
Websites of academic departments were not accessible to blind students.
That dispute was settled in 2011.
In 2011, the Federation also filed a discrimination complaint with the Justice
Department against Northwestern and New York Universities, alleging that
their use of Google apps disadvantaged visually impaired students because
the software that turns written words into spoken words was incompatible
with the Google software.
Meanwhile, two other organizations advocating for individuals with visual
impairments sued Arizona State University, which had distributed electronic
textbooks on Amazon Kindles. The lawsuit was settled, and the university
agreed to “strive to use devices that are accessible to the blind” (Huckabee,
January 11, 2010).
Similar complaints against other institutions (for example, Princeton
University, Pace University, and Case Western University) involving
e-readers were settled by the Department of Justice; the institutions now
require only those e-readers that are accessible to visually impaired
students. The Departments of Justice and Education issued a joint “Dear
Colleague” letter on June 29, 2010, that specifically addressed the limitations
of the Kindle DX model that these institutions had adopted for classroom use
and stated that the use of such technology is “unacceptable” when it is not
accessible to all students.
Finally, the Law School Admissions Council, which administers the Law
School Admissions Test and provides important information to law school
applicants, settled a lawsuit filed by the National Federation of the Blind that
asserted that the organization's website was inaccessible to applicants who
need to use screen-reader software. The Council agreed to make its entire
website accessible to visually impaired individuals.
Programs using e-readers or Web-based instruction need to ensure that
these technologies are accessible to visually impaired students. This may
require the institution to invest in equipment or software that will interact
appropriately with the technology used by these students to gain access to
curricular materials.
Comfort Animals on Campus
A set of new issues in accommodating students with disabilities concerns
whether colleges must allow “comfort animals” or “therapy animals”—often
recommended by an individual's therapist as an accommodation for various
psychiatric disorders—to reside with students in residence halls or to
accompany them to class or other college activities.
The Department of Justice has stated that a service animal may be a
required accommodation for a student with a disability, but the definition of
service animal is narrow. It is “any dog that is individually trained to do work
or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a
physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability” (28
C.F.R. §35.104).
Comfort animals, which are not trained and which may be any type of animal
that provides comfort or reassurance to a student with a disability, do not fit
within that definition (although, in some cases, miniature horses that have
been trained to work or perform tasks may be considered service animals).
Another law, the Fair Housing Act (FHA), defines an “assistance animal”
more broadly than the ADA's definition of “service animal” and includes
“emotional support” animals within its definition (73 Federal Register 63836).
Although there have been disputes as to whether or not the Fair Housing Act
applies to college residence halls or college-owned apartments, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, which enforces the FHA,
has determined that it does apply.
The regulations pertinent to assistance animals permit the college to require
students who request that they be permitted to keep an “emotional support
animal” in a residence hall to provide medical documentation that the animal
“alleviates at least one of the identified symptoms or effects of the existing
disability” (73 Federal Register 63835).
In late 2011, the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the
University of Nebraska at Kearney, stating that the university's denial of the
request by a student with a psychological disorder to keep a therapy dog in
her university-owned apartment violated the Fair Housing Act. In United
States of America v. University of Nebraska at Kearney (2013), the trial court
denied the university's motion for summary judgment, concluding that the
anti-discrimination provisions of the Fair Housing Act apply to university
housing and stating that a trial must be held.
And in Velzen v. Grand Valley State University (2012), a student was
prescribed an “emotional support” animal to help control her depression.
When Velzen asked that she be allowed to keep her guinea pig in her
residence hall apartment, the request was denied because the animal did
not meet the definition of “service animal” in that it was not trained to do work
or perform tasks. The lawsuit sought injunctive relief and compensatory
damages. Although the university asked the court to dismiss all of the
claims, the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief under the Fair Housing Act
and the compensatory damage claim for failure to accommodate under the
Rehabilitation Act survived dismissal. The case was settled in 2013 (Kaplin
and Lee 2013).
The ruling in the Kearney case and the possibility of additional litigation
involving “comfort animals” suggests a new area of concern for college
leaders. The college can require students who are permitted to keep animals
in their residence hall room to be responsible for their care and control, but it
is possible that roommates, suite-mates, or others who come into contact
with the animal may have allergies to pet dander or even psychiatric
conditions—such as phobias concerning reptiles, for example. Student
affairs administrators who deal with roommate incompatibility now have an
additional source of friction to deal with in resolving roommate or other
interpersonal disputes.
Students Who Engage in Risky Behavior
A third issue involving students with disabilities is how colleges deal with
students who may be a threat to themselves or to others. The incidents of
violence on campus, the most extensive of which were the shootings at
Virginia Tech, have raised the profile of this issue. Recent surveys have
indicated that one-third of college students have sought mental health
services, and 7 percent had seriously considered suicide (Sieben, 2011).
The US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has issued
guidance for colleges that are considering whether to require a student who
is at risk for harm to self or others to take a “medical withdrawal.” The
standard for making this determination is whether or not the student is a
“direct threat.” A student who is a direct threat is considered not to be
qualified to be a student (and thus unprotected by Section 504 and the
ADA); in such a case, the institution may place the student on a mandatory
medical withdrawal.
In determining whether a student is a “direct threat,” the ADA and Section
504 regulations require a college to perform an “individualized assessment”
of the nature of the student's disorder, the risk the student poses, the types
of accommodations that might minimize or eliminate that risk, and so forth.
Although the OCR had previously considered the student's risk to self as well
as to others to be sufficient to connote a direct threat, it recently adopted the
definition of the US Department of Justice, which discusses only whether the
student is a threat to others.
Therefore, it is less likely that a college can “solve” the “problem” of a
student who is engaging in behavior risky to the student, but not to others, by
requiring the student to withdraw. In fact, those colleges that have done so
without working through the individualized assessment required by OCR
have been found to violate the disability discrimination laws.
For this reason, and because colleges face an increasing risk of litigation if a
student commits suicide, institutions have invested in additional mental
health services or have entered into agreements with local or regional
mental health agencies to provide these services. They have also
recognized the need to train staff—especially residence life staff—to
recognize and respond appropriately to students who appear to be
contemplating or engaging in risky behavior. The Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act (FERPA), which requires that a student's education records
not be disclosed without the student's permission unless certain exceptions
apply, has an exception for health and safety emergencies, and does not
prevent college staff from dealing expeditiously with at-risk students.
If the student appears to be a risk to the safety of others, however, the
college may remove the student from campus, although a post-removal
hearing would be required at both public and private institutions in order to
perform the necessary individualized inquiry as to the possibility of
accommodating the student to reduce the risk. And students whose conduct
poses a risk to others may have violated the college's code of student
conduct or housing or academic policies; the college would then proceed
under that code or policy.
Dismissal of Students in Clinical Programs
The fourth area in which litigation by students with disabilities has increased
is dismissal from an academic program with a clinical component. These
student plaintiffs are often enrolled in health-related professional programs.
They may have performed well in traditional classroom settings but
encountered difficulties when required to practice what they had learned on
patients. Others are student teachers who had good grades but faltered
when they were required to interact with children in a classroom. The courts
have been quite deferential, in most cases, to the judgments of faculty that
students have not satisfied the academic requirements of the clinical portion
of their program and that any disability that the student may have was not
the motive for the dismissal.
In reviewing the claims of students who have been dismissed from college,
courts have distinguished between those dismissed on the basis of the
academic judgment of faculty, and those dismissed on the grounds of some
form of misconduct, whether social (such as assault or drug use) or
academic (such as cheating). Students dismissed for academic failure,
which has been determined by the application of faculty academic judgment,
have found that courts defer to that judgment. Courts are somewhat less
likely, however, to defer to a college's determination that social misconduct
was sufficient to justify separation from the institution (although colleges tend
to prevail in these cases as well, usually on procedural grounds).
Dismissals for failure in a clinical experience, such as a medical school
clinical rotation or a student teaching assignment, are often based on both
the failure of academic performance and a failure in conduct. For example, is
a judgment by a supervising faculty member that a medical student is
insufficiently deferential to that faculty member's expertise or instructions an
academic failure or actual misconduct? Is a student teacher's “poor attitude”
toward her classroom students a professional failure (involving academic
judgment) or misbehavior? Most courts have spent very little time addressing
these questions, determining that faculty judgments about student behavior
in a clinical setting are “academic judgments” and thus should be reviewed
deferentially.
An illustrative case is Halpern v. Wake Forest University Health Sciences
(2012). A medical student had been diagnosed with ADHD and was on
medication to alleviate its symptoms. During his clinical rotations,
supervising faculty documented numerous instances of “unprofessional
behavior, which included his resistance to feedback, rudeness,
[inappropriate] treatment of staff members, and absences.” Halpern was
dismissed from the medical school. He sued under both the Rehabilitation
Act and the ADA, claiming that the medical school had not accommodated
his disability.
The court made short work of Halpern's claim, determining that it was his
behavior, not his disability, that motivated his dismissal. Although the court
explained that the US Supreme Court precedent with respect to evaluating
faculty academic judgments required a measure of judicial deference, it
noted that it must determine whether the medical school fulfilled its duty to
accommodate a student with a disability. The court then determined that
professional behavior was an essential part of the role of a physician, and
that Halpern's inability to behave in a professional manner meant that he
was not qualified to be a medical student or a doctor (under the ADA's
definition of “qualified”).
The court rejected Halpern's argument that he deserved a “second chance”
to behave in a more professional manner, given that his misconduct had
extended over several years. The court concluded that there was no
accommodation that would ensure that Halpern could moderate his behavior,
and thus it ruled in favor of the medical school.
A second case also addresses the behavioral aspects of satisfying the
requirements of a professional degree program. In Herzog v. Loyola College
in Maryland (2009), the plaintiff, Mr. Herzog, had earned an undergraduate
and two master's degrees without any problems. He then enrolled in a
doctoral program in clinical psychology. Although Herzog had been
diagnosed with ADHD, he did not inform the college of his disability, nor did
he request any accommodations until late in his doctoral program, when he
requested additional time on two tests, which the college provided.
Herzog earned excellent grades in his classroom-based courses, although
several faculty had expressed concerns about his behavior—in particular, his
‘lack of awareness of [his] impact on others” and his inability “to recognize
power differentials.” Herzog then applied for a required internship in his final
year of the doctoral program at a site at Montana State University. In
completing paperwork as a new employee at the internship site, Herzog
indicated that he did not have any disabilities.
During the course of the internship, Herzog engaged in behaviors that his
supervisors judged to be unprofessional, including “pursuing” a student in a
class he was teaching and an apparent inability to recognize “power
differentials” and to behave in a professional manner. Although the internship
supervisor was willing to place Herzog on a remediation plan, the faculty at
Loyola College determined that his “persistent pattern” of misconduct
justified his dismissal from the program.
The court agreed that ADHD could be considered a disability in Herzog's
situation, but his strong academic performance throughout his academic
career, without accommodations, indicated that the disorder did not
substantially limit his ability to learn (a required showing under the ADA).
Noting that courts are expected to defer to faculty academic judgments
about student performance, the court rejected Herzog's claim that his
dismissal was related to his disability, noting that Herzog's problematic
behavior was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his dismissal. The
court commented: “It is well within Loyola's discretion to dismiss a student
who has problems with authority, difficulty understanding the impact of his
conduct on others and who has conceded to breaching ethical standards
promulgated by the school.”
These two cases are typical of judicial responses to claims by professional
school students that the college should have been more proactive in
forgiving or accommodating misconduct that the student alleges is a
manifestation of the disability. And although some commentators argue that
punishing a student with a disability for misconduct that is related to that
disability is itself illegal (Korn, 2003), the courts do not agree.
If the college can demonstrate 1) that the problematic behavior is contrary to
the ethical or professional standards of the profession and 2) that faculty and
others attempted to work with the student to correct the behavior, but that the
problem persisted, courts will defer to the academic judgment of the faculty
that the student is unfit for that particular profession.
Implications for Campus Leaders
As science progresses and we learn more about the nature and cause of
physical and mental disorders, it is likely than a larger proportion of college
students will request, and will be entitled to, accommodations. Advances in
technology have greatly expanded colleges' ability to accommodate certain
disorders, although, as addressed earlier in this article, they have also acted
in ways that may exclude students with other types of disorders.
The good news for college leaders is that the courts are, for the most part,
committed to upholding academic standards and are usually deferential to
the faculty's exercise of academic judgment (unless the court determines
that academic judgment was not really exercised and some impermissible
motive for the student's “mistreatment” is evident). New accommodation
requests and justifications will undoubtedly arise, and college leaders will
need to develop policies to address emerging issues that were unrecognized
even a few years ago.
But at least for now, the appropriate exercise of academic judgment, sincere
attempts to work with the student to minimize the effects of the disability, and
clear-eyed focus on ensuring that academic standards are upheld should
result in a favorable disposition of any litigation that may ensue.

Challenges encounter students 
with physical disabilities 
at the Hashemite University in Jordan
Mu'tasem M. Al Masa'deh1
Abstract
Although higher education for students with disabilities has become more 
and more accessible, the environments of some universities and colleges 
still limit students' potentials. This research was aimed to explore the 
most relevant challenges that students with physical disability have to 
face at The Hashemite University in Jordan. A quantitative design was 
employed wherein a questionnaire was developed to collect the data. The 
study sample consisted of sixty-three (63) students with physical 
disability, who were recruited from both humanities and scientific 
faculties at the Hashemite University. Results revealed that students with 
physical disabilities faced moderate levels of challenges. The way they 
perceived challenges differed on the basis of the study variables, namely 
gender, academic year, and faculty type. Significant statistical 
differences were found in students' perception of challenges within some 
domains of the study tool. These results are consistent with the existing 
literature. Based on research outcomes, some recommendations are 
finally provided for policy-making and practice.

1. Introduction and background
Undoubtedly, every individual with disability is entitled to access 
appropriate education that suits his/her characteristics and abilities, and this 
is true for any school levels, from primary to higher education. Article 24 of 
the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (CRPD) has endorsed their right to have inclusive and equitable 
higher education (UN, 2006). This notion was adopted by the American 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 2004). This law insisted 
the right for people with disabilities to receive free inclusive education 
services. According to IDEA, students with disabilities should access higher 
education in the least restrictive environment. Therefore, higher educational 
institutions should work to achieve reasonable accommodation for students 
with disabilities (Agarwal, Calvo, & Kumar, 2014; Thompson-Ebanks, 
2014; Abdella, 2018).
The legislative initiatives for students with disabilities in higher 
education have contributed to increase the number of students with 
disabilities in the universities worldwide (Squelch, 2010; Melero, Moriña, & 
López-Aguilar, 2018). Within the Jordanian context, higher education policy 
framework has a strong equity agenda as well, for example, the Law on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities No. 20 for the Year 2017. Article 21 of 
this law states that “No person may be excluded from higher education 
institutions or be denied the right to study any specializations available 
therein on the basis of, or because of, disability” [Higher Council for the 
Affairs of Persons with Disabilities (HCAPD), 2017]. This new law clearly 
emphasizes the role of the Ministry of Higher Education, who has to ensure 
easy and free access to inclusive higher educational institutions, reasonable 
accommodation, and adjustable admission requirements for students with 
disabilities.
2. Literature review
Although the university enrollment rate of students with disabilities in 
postsecondary education has dramatically increased, their graduation rates 
are still low compared to those of their non-disabled peers (Barnar-Brak, 
Lectenberger, & Lan, 2010; Marshak, Van Wieren, Ferrell, Swiss, & Dugan, 
2010; Black, Weinberg, & Brodwin, 2015). This lower performance in 
higher education institutions may result from challenges that students with 
disabilities have to face during their study (Webster, 2004; Agarwal et al., 
Challenges encounter students with physical disabilities ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
45
2014). Accordingly, some studies have shown that the persistence and 
retention rates in universities and colleges among students with disabilities 
are lower than those of their peers (Getzel, 2008; Thompson-Ebanks, 2014; 
Fleming, Plotner, & Oertle, 2017).
Most of the research studies have dealt with students with disabilities in 
higher education (colleges and universities). While part of the research 
focused on the willingness of college and university staff to provide 
reasonable accommodation, other studies were more concerned with the 
barriers that students with disabilities encounter in higher education 
institutions.
2.1. Accommodation for students with disabilities
Researchers reported that most lecturers and workers in higher education 
institutions were willing to offer accommodation for students with 
disabilities (Sweener, Kundert, May, & Quinn, 2002; Phillippe, 2012; 
Alhossein, 2014; Kusek, 2017; Abdella, 2018). The existing literature 
reported various forms of accommodation that could facilitate higher 
education for students with disabilities and increase their attendance and 
graduation likelihood. These accommodation services could be, for example, 
adjusting entrances, modifying course materials and assessment tools, and 
offering certain devices or equipment (Squelch, 2010; Kilpatrick, Johns, 
Barnes, Fischer, McLennan, & Magnussen, 2017), giving deadline 
extensions to fulfill assignments (Hewett, Douglas, McClinden, & Keil, 
2017), and residential and recreational facilities (Barnar-Brak et al., 2010). 
In contrast, in a qualitative study by Ginsberg and Schulte (2008), some 
participants perceived the provision of university special accommodation to 
students with disabilities as an unfair practice. The lecturers believed they 
couldn’t account for being responsible of students' disabilities; consequently, 
they were unwilling to make any adjustment either in their teaching methods 
or in testing system for students with disabilities (Ginsberg & Schulte, 
2008). These findings were reflected in many studies, in which lecturers 
turned out to be unwilling to provide accommodation and dissatisfied with 
making changes for students with disabilities (Skinner, 2007; Baker, 
Bolland, & Nowik, 2012; Sniatecki, Perry, & Snell, 2015).
Although students with disabilities who had the opportunity to access 
available accommodations seemed to achieve better academic results, 
research demonstrated how they were sometimes reluctant to use these 
services or tended to differ the seeking for this kind of support (Barnar-Brak 
Life Span and Disability Al Masa׳deh M. M.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
46
et al., 2010; Lightner, Kipps-Vaughan, Schulte, & Trice, 2012; Herridge, 
2017). Marshak et al. (2010) interviewed 16 students with different types of 
disabilities who were studying at colleges in USA. According to researchers, 
some factors seemed to keep students with disabilities from requesting 
disability support services, for example “a desire to redefine personal 
identity, to avoid social stigma and negative peer and faculty reactions, 
difficulty explaining their disability-related needs, and being disappointed 
with the utility of accommodations received” (p.160). Further, the fact of 
having no knowledge about disability services available in educational 
settings was another factor that hindered students with disabilities from 
using these services (Álvarez Pérez, Alegre de la Rosa, & López Aguilar,

2.2. Challenges faced by students with disabilities in higher education
Álvarez Pérez et al. (2012) estimated that only 3% of students with 
disabilities who accessed higher education achieved their university degrees. 
This low graduation rate might originate from the challenges that those 
students encountered during their university or college lives. The transition 
of students with disabilities from secondary school to higher education 
involves many hindrances, as they will experience new challenging 
environments that students without disabilities may not have to face 
(Webster, 2004; Eckes & Ochoa, 2005; Cawthon & Cole, 2010; Lowen & 
Pollard, 2010).
Several studies have investigated challenges that students with 
disabilities encounter. Such studies have used different methodological 
approaches, often recruiting students with varying disabilities. For example, 
Stallman (2011) screened the psychological distress among students who 
enrolled in two large Australian universities. She found that students with 
disabilities showed higher levels of psychological distress than those without 
disabilities. Agarwal, Moya, Yasui and Seymour (2015) conducted a 
participatory action research with six students with a variety of disabilities at 
American universities. Researchers reported feelings of isolation and peers 
negative attitudes as being the most important barriers experienced by 
participants (Agarwal et al., 2015). Soorenian (2017) explored the higher 
education lives of 30 international students with disabilities studying at 11 
UK universities. Participants experienced two main challenges: poor 
information about available accommodation, and unavailable physical 
accessibility. Fleming et al. (2017) carried out a survey on 325 students with 
Challenges encounter students with physical disabilities ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

a wide range of disabilities enrolled in three large American universities, 
focusing on how they perceived the university environments. The analysis of 
data collected suggests that although participants perceived many services as 
being helpful, on the other hand, they felt that the university staff were not 
trained enough to deal with them and lacked specific knowledge about 
disabilities (Fleming et al., 2017). The negative interaction between faculties 
and students with disabilities as well as attitudinal barriers were highlighted 
in many studies (Holloway, 2001; Shevlin, Kenny, & McNeela, 2004; 
Tagayuna, Stodden, Chang, Zeleznik, & Whelley, 2005; Haller, 2006; 
Barnard, Stevens, Siwatu, & Lan, 2008; Erten, 2011; Banks, 2014; Gelbar, 
Madaus, Lombardi, Faggella-Luby, & Dukes, 2015; Yssel, Pak, & Beilke, 
2016). These findings were also reported in case of students with invisible 
disabilities (Krider, Bendixen, & Lutz, 2015).
Researchers from non-Western settings have shown similar outcomes. 
For example in China, Hong (2015) collected qualitative data from 16 
students with disabilities who had enrolled in postsecondary education; 
participants reported to have experienced daily challenges such as faculty 
belief, unprofessional support services, ableism, and low expectations from 
the counselors. In Kenya, similar findings were found in a study with 20 
female students with disabilities from two public universities (Opini, 2012). 
The female students reported further hindrances, such as the lack of 
transport, paucity of financial resources and sexual abuse (Opini, 2012). 
Women with disabilities in Dar es Salaam University in Tanzania 
experienced inaccessible learning and physical distress, due to, for example, 
inappropriate teaching methods and materials, and unorganized classrooms 
(Matonya, 2016). Mutanga (2017) reviewed some studies regarding students 
with disabilities in South African higher education institutions. Among the 
common challenges typically reported in the literature, in this study 
researchers have described poor physical access and lacking of disability 
policy as being the most significant challenges (Mutanga, 2017). In Saudi 
Arabia, Al-khashrami (2011) explored the views of students with disabilities 
enrolled at King Saud University. Although students felt that the instructors 
had positive attitudes toward them, the accommodation services did not 
meet their needs and teaching methods were rather inappropriate (Alkhashrami, 2011). Moreover, students with disabilities at Kuwait University 
reported other challenges such as not being accepted by their peers, 
unavailable facilities, unsuitable library resources, and structural barriers 
(Al-Shammeri, 2008).

Overall, the existing studies in the literature seem to indicate that students 
with disabilities in higher education institutions continue to experience 
various challenges, including attitudinal, architectural, personal, and 
institutional barriers. However, although the vast majority of research in the 
last two decades has tended to concentrate on the population with disability 
as a whole, rather than considering groups of students with specific 
impairments separately, the samples included in these studies were rather 
small (Gelbar et al., 2015). Moreover, most of the research studies have 
been conducted in Western countries, therefore there is a limited amount of 
research investigating the status of postsecondary education for students 
with disabilities in the Arab world; more specifically, there appear to be no 
studies on challenges encountered by students with physical disabilities at 
Jordanian Universities. This study aims to contribute to the existing 
literature on identifying the barriers that restrict inclusive higher education 
services for students with physical disabilities. Results are expected to also 
help policymakers and service providers in overcoming such difficulties and 
eventually improve the experiences of students with disabilities in colleges 
and universities. Specifically, this study aims to answer the following 
research questions: (a) What level of challenges are students with physical 
disabilities encountering at the Hashemite University? (b) Are there 
differences in the type of challenges reported depending on students' gender, 
faculty, and year of study?
3. Setting
This research took place at The Hashemite University, one of the highranking universities among Jordanian public higher educational institutions. 
The university offers various types of services for students who were 
identified as having a disability. In the academic year 2015/2016, there were 
126 students with disabilities enrolled in the university faculties, 25 of them 
presenting with hearing impairment, 31 with visual impairment, and 80 with 
physical disabilities. Services provided for those students by the university 
consisted in sign language translation, note taking, a reader and a scribe 
during exams, recorded courses, as well as discounted fees.
4. Method
This study was based on a quantitative approach, with the use of a 
questionnaire design to identify the challenges faced by students with

physical disabilities at The Hashemite University. Results were expected to 
be helpful for students in enjoying their higher education experience, 
developing their potentials and attaining their goals. A quantitative design 
was also used to measure challenges as perceived by students and to 
establish whether and which variables might influence such challenges. 
Perceived challenges have been obtained by collecting quantitative data 
which have been subsequently analyzed with statistical methods.
4.1. Research population
The study population consisted of all students who were identified as 
having physical disabilities and enrolled at the Hashemite University in 
Jordan during the academic year 2017/2018. According to the university 
enrollment office, there were 41 males and 39 females, enrolled in scientific 
as well as human faculties.
4.2. Sample and recruitment
After obtaining ethics approval, the research coordinator, starting from a 
list provided by the Deanship of Students Affairs that included detailed 
information about the students with physical disabilities enrolled in the 
university, contacted those students by phone to see whether they would 
give their consent to participate in the research.

numbers provided were wrong or unreachable. Finally, 63 students accepted 
to participate and answered the questionnaire administered. Table 1 provides 
information for each student according to gender, faculty type, and year of 
study.
4.3. Instruments
A questionnaire was purposefully designed to identify challenges that 
students with physical disabilities were encountering. In the process of 
developing the questionnaire items, two methods were applied: (1) 
reviewing the related literature published in the international databases; and 
(2) asking six students with physical disabilities who had completed their 
bachelor degrees the following question: “What challenges have you faced 
during your studies at the university?”. This process resulted in a list of 
items which were grouped by the researcher and collated under six domains.
In order to ensure its validity, the questionnaire was sent to five 
professors specialized in education of disabled students, who were asked to 
rate the questionnaire items and domains. The final version of the 
questionnaire, which included professors’ revisions and comments, was 
made of 89 items covering six domains. Definition and number of items in 
each domain were the following: (I) Learning (24 items): this domain refers 
to any changes or rearrangements by the lecturers in order to ensure students 
with physical disabilities equal access to full lecture experiences. New 
teaching strategies, assignments, testing systems, and seating arrangements, 
use of special devices and classroom adaptations were among the most 
important changes introduced. (II) Architecture (16 items): this domain 
measures the appropriateness of university buildings, utilities, and spaces for 
students with physical disabilities. (III) Mobility (11 items): this domain taps 
on the challenges encountered by students with physical disabilities, limiting 
their mobility and movement to reach the university and access classes. (IV) 
Accessibility and availability of related information (9 items): this domain 
refers to whether students with physical disabilities find the relevant 
information as being available and accessible, for example having equitable 
access to the library services. (V) Administration (12 items): this domain 
investigates the availability of professional employees at the university to 
advice and guide students with physical disabilities whenever it is the case. 
(VI) Psychological and social self-adjustment (17 items): this domain 
assesses the challenges that prevent students with physical disabilities from

being psychologically and socially adapted at the university, for example, 
interaction with others, negative attitudes, and communication difficulties. 
Cronbach's alpha was used as a measure of internal consistency of the 
instrument. 20 students with disabilities, who were studying in other 
universities, completed the questionnaire and their results were statistically 
analyzed. We correlated the score from each domain with the total score of 
the questionnaire. Table 2 shows that the reliability coefficients for all the 
domains ranged between .76 and .89, which was deemed satisfactory for the 
reliability of the questionnaire domains.

The questionnaire consisted of two parts: Part A included demographic 
data of respondents (gender, year of study, and college type); Part B 
included 89 self-report items. Potential students were required to rate their 
perceived levels of challenges using a four-point Likert scale. The 
questionnaire items had two kinds of action statements; the first type of 
items were positive action statements (always = 4, often = 3, sometimes = 2, 
and never = 1), while the other type of items were negative action statements 
(always = 1, often = 2, sometimes = 3, and never = 4).
5. Results 
The software Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 
22.0, was used to make statistical analyses. Means (M) and Standard 
Deviations (SD) were calculated to identify the level of challenges that the 
participants encounter at the university (Tab. 3).

The table shows that, overall, students with physical disabilities at 
Hashemite University face moderate level of challenges in the 
Administration domain, scoring the highest mean (2.62). However, it is also 
worth noting that the Psychological and Social Self-adjustment domain had 
the lowest mean (1.42), thus indicating that students encountered low level 
of challenges with regard to psychological and social self-adjustment.
Two-independent sample t-test and One-way ANOVA were used with 
the purpose of detecting any differences in the challenge levels according to 
the study variables.

Having gender and college type as the study variables across the six 
domains of the questionnaire, a two-independent sample t-test was applied. 
Results revealed that there were significant statistical differences in the 
Architecture domain in favor of female students (Tab. 4).
There were also significant statistical differences in the Learning and 
Information Accessibility and Availability domains in favor of scientific

6. Discussion
This study aimed to explore challenges faced by students with physical 
disabilities enrolled at Hashemite University. However, despite Jordan 
initiatives to enact local legislation and ratify international conventions 
related to the right of persons with disabilities to access inclusive higher 
education settings, results of this study still highlight several difficulties at 
university. As an example, the item “The number of toilets near the lecture 
halls is appropriate”, included in the Architecture domain, was frequently 
rated as being a challenge. This might be explained by the fact that the 
higher education institutions in Jordan have not taken serious steps to 
implement the local Law on the rights of persons with disabilities (HCAPD, 
2017). Thompson (2018) reviewed the current situation of individuals with 
disabilities in Jordan; he reported that most persons with disabilities 
experience difficulties in public places, such as accessibility barriers in 
schools and universities, therefore, he recommended that “existing schools 
and universities must be refurbished to facilitate access to students with 
disabilities” (p.40). This is urging the application of universal designs for the 
new buildings in order to make them accessible to all people without 
requiring further adaptations. Moreover, negative attitudes toward 
disabilities from the local communities continue to hinder promoting equal 
and inclusive education in Jordan (Hyassat, 2013; 2016).
Although Gelbar et al. (2015) contended that students with physical 
disabilities were among the first students who accessed accommodation 
services in higher education institutions, research participants declared they 
were still struggling to find accessible means of transport (Opini, 2012). To 
ensure equal access to higher education for students with physical 
disabilities, colleges and universities are required to offer reasonable 
accommodation in their facilities and classrooms (Abes & Wallace, 2018). 
Unfortunately, students seem to experience mobility constraints, as lectures 
are usually kept in different blocks of the same university campus, thus 
forcing them to move from one class to another. Indeed, the item “I can 
move inside the university easily and smoothly” was rarely rated positively. 
Classes and labs were unadjusted to suit students’ characteristics and meet 
their needs. Further, like most of Soorenian's (2017) participants, students 
with physical disabilities recruited in this study faced difficulties in 
obtaining accessible and relevant information.
Specifically, the fifth domain of the questionnaire, Administration, 
ranked on top of the challenges encountered by students, probably due to the 
Life Span and Disability Al Masa׳deh M. M.

56
university staff that are not adequately trained to deal with students with 
disabilities. This was clear in the participants' responses to the item “I find it 
difficult to communicate with the university employees”. This finding is 
consistent with those of other studies conducted worldwide (Holloway,
2001; Shevline et al., 2004; Tagayuna et al., 2005; Haller, 2006; Barnard et 
al., 2008; Opini, 2012; Banks, 2014; Gelbar et al., 2015; Yssel et al., 2016; 
Fleming et al., 2017). In reviewing the literature on teaching students with 
disabilities at post-secondary school, Dyer (2018) concluded that “the 
college or university and its faculty must be knowledgeable regarding 
disability law and accommodations” (p.78). This can be definitely applicable 
to higher education institutions in Jordan, since it would help alleviate 
difficulties that students with disabilities encounter in their university life 
because of several barriers.
However, the barriers reported by participants as being less challenging 
fell into the “Psychological and Social Self-adjustment” domain. It seems 
that students with physical disabilities feel happy with being included in the 
university with other students; this may give them a sense of equity, 
opportunities to socially interact and being accepted by others. The majority 
of students with physical disabilities in this research rated the item “I have 
many non-disabled friends in the university” as “always”. Ultimately, this 
could also positively affect their general level of social and psychological 
adjustment. Al-Shammeri (2018) found that including students with 
disabilities in a university setting improved their skills to challenge their 
disabilities and lessen their life stress. This result is also consistent with Alkhashrami's (2011) study, which concluded that, offering chances for 
interaction between students with disabilities and their peers created, in turn, 
positive attitudes toward students with disabilities.
In the evaluation of how gender affects the perceived level of challenges, 
female students turned out to encounter higher levels of difficulties, 
specifically in terms of architectural barriers. This may be a reflection of 
Arab cultural aspects and at times religious principles, where male students 
can freely ask others for help when in need, while female students are 
restricted in doing so. In similar social contexts, e.g. in Saudi Arabia, Alkhashrami (2011) found that female students had more negative attitudes 
toward suitability of university places and facilities.

7. Limitations
Like in the majority of quantitative studies, this study presented some 
limitations. The first limitation was that all participants were recruited from 
the same university; students with physical disabilities in other Jordanian 
universities may have different experiences. Another limitation was that no 
information were obtained from students with other types of disabilities; 
additional data on challenge perceptions would certainly contribute to 
enlarge knowledge on students’ experiences. However, information 
collected from the study sample were rather significant in terms of 
understanding the experience of students with physical disabilities, which 
would help develop more inclusive environments.
8. Conclusion and Future Research
Although this research study involved participants with only one type of 
disability and enrolled at one public university, it addressed attitudinal, 
architectural, personal, and institutional challenges that students with 
physical impairment encounter in Jordanian universities and colleges. To 
overcome these challenges, higher educational institutions should provide 
appropriate support to students with disabilities that suites their individual 
characteristics (Van, Moyson, & Roeyers, 2015).
To the best of my knowledge, this study is an initial step to pave the way 
for understanding the challenges faced by university students with 
disabilities. Results from this study might be helpful to policy makers in 
planning future inclusive and equitable higher education settings. This can 
be achieved with the contribute of policies that focus on increased campus 
accessibility, appropriate accommodation, and improved faculty attitudes 
and academic culture. Furthermore, it is extremely important to place greater 
emphasis on transition programs from high school to higher education, in 
order to prepare students with disabilities for post-secondary education.
Based on these results, I recommend that future research include students 
with different types of impairments, such as hearing and visual impairment 
and learning difficulties; it would seem also appropriate to add more 
research variables, such as social and economical background of students. 
Moreover, qualitative studies would provide a deeper understanding of 
research results. Finally, colleges and academic staff perspectives are 
important factor that account for successful planning of higher education

Abstract
Purpose: The study explores: (1) the scope and nature of the
consequences that adults with disabilities perceive as the result
of inappropriate access to health care services; (2) the
variability of these consequences by demographic attributes
such as disability type, gender, and health insurance type; and
(3) the inter-relatedness and multidimensionality of these
consequences.
Methods: Qualitative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews
were administered over the telephone to 30 participants with
spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis as part
of a nation-wide study on access and utilisation in the USA.
Interviews were transcribed and coded for analysis using the
qualitative analysis program, NVivo.
Results: Consequences were grouped into one of five
categories: social, psychological, physical, economic and
independence issues. Responses differed slightly with regard
to disability type, gender and health insurance type. There was
substantial overlap among consequence categories. For most
respondents, negative consequences were not limited to just
one areaÐfrequently, one consequence triggered others.
Conclusions: Health insurers and providers need a better
understanding of the multiple consequences of access barriers.
Based on this knowledge, detrimental and costly effects of
inappropriate service delivery could be more effectively
prevented. Implications for health care services and policy
are discussed.
Introduction
In the US there are approximately 22 million working-age people (between 21 and 64 years old) with a
disability.1 Often, individuals with disabilities face
speci®c problems in accessing health care services.2
Some people with physical disabilities may have to
rely on health care and support services more regularly than individuals without disabilities to monitor
their condition over time, and to prevent costly and
debilitating medical complications. However, they
may not have the ®nancial means or the personal
assistance that may be necessary to access the health
care system as needed. The research presented in this
paper illustrates how inappropriate (i.e. denied or
delayed) access to needed health care services can lead
to negative consequences for the health, well being,
independence, and quality of life of adults with
disabilities. A better understanding of access barriers
is important in order to avoid the costly and detrimental consequences for both people with disabilities and
the society in which they live, which often pays for
these consequences.
Many of the barriers to health care access are associated with lack of health insurance, ethnic/racial minority status and low income.3±9 Recent research has also
highlighted the physical and environmental barriers
(i.e. oce and building accessibility) to Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance.10 ± 12 Although the
barriers to health care for people with disabilities have
been described in qualitative studies,13 ± 15 limited qualitative research exists about the consequences that adults
with disabilities experience as a result of these access
barriers. This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of:
. the scope and nature of consequences that adults with
disabilities perceive as the result of denied or delayed
access to health care services;
. the variability of these consequences by demographic
attributes such as disability type, gender, and health
insurance type; and

. the inter-relatedness and multidimensionality of these
consequences.
The ®ndings presented in the article stem from a
qualitative study of working age adults with spinal cord
injury (SCI), cerebral palsy (CP) or multiple sclerosis
(MS). The study participants self-reported on consequences of inappropriate access to health care for their
health, lives, and service use. This exploration of multilayed consequences intends to provide an impetus to
revisit the state of current health care delivery for adults
with disabilities, and generate strategies for improvements in health care access, health maintenance, and
health care ®nancing.
Data and methods
STUDY DESIGN
This qualitative research was one component of a 3-
year quantitative prospective study designed to assess
the health care experiences of individuals in the USA
with SCI, CP or MS. The quantitative component was
comprised of a longitudinal, self-report mail survey
administered yearly. The survey focused on dierences
in access, utilisation and satisfaction among people with
SCI, CP, or MS who were enrolled in managed care
(MC) or fee-for-service (FFS) health insurance plans.
In the survey, respondents were asked to select the
general insurance plan type that best described their
primary health insurance coverage at the current time.
Managed care plans were de®ned by the study team in
the following manner:
An insurance plan in which all or most of the
health care you receive is from doctors who are associated with the plan. Some managed care plans
allow you to visit doctors not associated with the
plan, but this involves an extra cost to you. Generally, you do not have to submit claims for the costs
of medical services, and you may be required to
visit your primary care doctor before visiting a
specialist.
A Fee-for-Service plan was de®ned as:
Traditional health insurance that allows you to
choose your provider and the services you receive
without limitation. Claims are ®led by you or your
doctor for health services received, and the insurance company covers the services after you pay a
deductible amount.
The longitudinal, quantitative study used a national,
community-based sample of working-age adults
(n=537) in the USA that was recruited mainly through
national membership organizations for people with SCI,
CP, and MS. Other recruitment methods included
advertising in disability-speci®c newsletters and other
national disability-related publications, posting on email list-servers, and displaying posters at Independent
Living Centres and public libraries.
SUBJECT SELECTION
Survey respondents were considered eligible for participation in the qualitative component of the study if
they reported access problems in at least three out of ®ve
speci®c health service areas, including `primary care',
`specialist care', `rehabilitative services', `mental health',
and `durable medical equipment'. Access to these
services is particularly crucial for people with disabilities
in terms of long-term health maintenance and prevention of complications and secondary health problems,
so the in-depth interview questions focused on these
same service areas. Of the 49 respondents who met the
eligibility criteria during the ®rst year of the longitudinal
survey, 30 adults between the ages of 18 and 65 were
purposefully selected for the qualitative telephone interviews. Participants were selected with the goal of
approximating a relatively even representation of
disability groups, women and men, and health insurance
type in the ®nal qualitative sample.
Several authors have considered qualitative interviews
a valuable method in the policy and programme evaluation process.16 ± 18 A phenomenological approach was
adopted in this study. In this approach, researchers have
some prior knowledge in the topical area and seek more
in-depth understanding of the data. This study aims for
a greater understanding of the survey data that was
collected and analysed prior to the interviewing process.
INTERVIEW GUIDE
The interview guide was developed in an iterative
process. Content areas were de®ned based on the longitudinal survey. In total, the ®ve aforementioned service
areas were addressed in the interview guide. As a ®rst
step, a set of preliminary questions were developed,
and subsequently re®ned. In order to ensure methodological rigour in the data collection and analysis process,
all members of the research team participated in a
formal, interviewer training session. The interview guide
was then pilot-tested with two randomly selected respondents from the national survey. Their input led to further
M. T. Neri and T. Kroll
86
re®nement of the questions, and produced additional
probes. Advice was also solicited on length, verbal and
cognitive appropriateness, and comprehension from
our research colleagues with physical disabilities.
The ®nal interview guide contained 10 core questions
addressing four general topics for each service area: (1)
perceived barriers to health care; (2) perceived consequences resulting from barriers to health care; (3) experiences with health care co-ordination; and (4)
improvement of access to health care for people with
disabilities. For each question, a set of speci®c probes
made it possible for the interviewer to elicit detailed
descriptions of the nature and context of speci®c
barriers and consequences. The actual number of questions asked of respondents varied depending on the
number of access diculties they had reported in the
survey. For example, 19 respondents experienced access
diculties in only three of the ®ve service areas we were
interested in, therefore they were only asked questions
regarding those three service areas.
DATA ANALYSIS AND CODING
The research team conducted all interviews over the
telephone between March and August 2000. Each interview was audiotaped and transcribed. Interview transcripts were then imported into the qualitative
software, NVivo19,20 for content coding and analysis.
Computer software such as NVivo has been found bene-
®cial for health services researchers in terms of speed,
consistency, rigour, and access to broader analytical
methods (e.g. integration of qualitative and quantitative
techniques).21 NVivo allows the researcher to code for
themes that emerge from the data, combine those
themes, and further arrange and organise them into a
hierarchical structure.
As a ®rst step, `codes', or thematic groupings of the
consequences (e.g. independence restricted; secondary
physical conditions) were created independently by
two members of the research team. One hundred and
seventeen codes were initially identi®ed. Both analysts
compared their coding and agreed upon a ®nal set of
codes, which reduced the overall number of codes used
to 41 (table 1). All transcripts were then thoroughly
re-coded by both researchers. To facilitate analysis these
codes were then grouped into the following ®ve `consequence categories' of social, psychological, physical,
economic and independence issues in order to ease the
comparison of these consequences with regard to the
following attributes: disability type, gender, and health
insurance type.
Further, these consequence categories were sorted and
analysed by the demographic attributes `disability type',
`gender', and `health insurance type' to identify variability and dierences of consequences by these attributes.
In a ®nal analytical step, three transcripts were purposefully selected for case studies based on their ability
to describe how the consequences were inter-related and
multidimensional. These case studies serve as examples
of the complex picture of the consequences that are
experienced by adults with disabilities as a result of
barriers to health care.
SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
Table 2 provides details about the composition of the
sample. The sample included 10 respondents from each
of the three disability groups in the study: SCI, CP, and
MS. Sixteen women and 14 men with a mean age of 44.8
years (SD=8.30) were interviewed. The geographic
distribution of the study participants was relatively even
across the four major US census regions.
More than two-thirds of the respondents indicated
additional health problems, including, but not limited
to, pain, musculo-skeletal problems (e.g. arthritis), and
mental health problems (e.g. depression). Despite this
substantial amount of co-morbidity experienced by our
sample, nearly half of the participants described their
health status as being excellent, very good, or good.
However, all respondents but one (missing response)
reported limitations in an instrumental activity of daily
living (IADL, see table 2), and approximately two-thirds
reported limitations in at least one activity of daily living
(ADL).

Findings
Below, each consequence category is described,
followed by the dierences in reported consequences
by disability type, gender, and health insurance type.
Finally, the three purposefully selected case studies will
be used to describe how perceived barriers to health care
may produce multi-dimensional, interrelated consequences for persons with SCI, CP, and MS.
The 30 qualitative study respondents identi®ed a
multitude of consequences resulting from environmental
(e.g. inaccessible provider facilities and equipment),
structural (e.g. availability and choice of providers),
and procedural (e.g. timely appointments; complex
referral process for downstream services) barriers to
needed health care services.22 The consequence categories were comprised of social, psychological, physical,
and economic consequences, as well as consequences
related to issues of independence.
CONSEQUENCES
Social
The social consequences of barriers to health care
encompassed strained relationships with family, friends,
and colleagues, as well as modi®cations to existing social
roles, and limitations in societal participation.
Relationships. Several respondents noted that their
relationships with family members and friends had been
impacted as a consequence of not getting access to
needed primary care services or durable medical equipment (DME). Workplace relationships were also
aected, as is illustrated by the response of a 36-yearold female with MS. She could not locate a provider
who was knowledgeable about MS and did not want
to visit her current doctor, so as a result she was `a little
bit hard to get along with because I didn't feel real good
. . . I was not fun to be around' at work. Another
respondent with SCI was also unable to see his primary
care provider in a timely manner. He succinctly sums up
the consequences: `If I'm sick, then I'm grumpy and
unpleasant to be around, and at the same time, demanding more assistance from people around me, so it's a bad
combination . . . relationships were tested'.
Social roles. Existing and desired social roles were also
threatened by inappropriate access to health care as
some found it dicult to maintain the level of social
contributions that they were either used to, or wanted
to make. One woman in her early ®fties was on Social

Security Disability Income (SSDI) due to her CP, and
her `doctor didn't feel that it was necessary that I have
occupational therapy, that I'm on disability and he
didn't feel it was necessary at the time'. She felt that
she couldn't just `sit around the house and do nothing.
I have to be able to feel like I'm worthwhile doing something, even if it's sitting down and stung envelopes'.
She was used to working as a nurse and being gainfully
employed, but was unable to continue her role in the
work force because she was unable to obtain a referral
for occupational therapy.
Social participation. Many respondents reported a
decrease in social participation brought on by their
restricted mobility as a consequence of not being able
to obtain health care services that would have enhanced
their mobility. For example, a common scenario was
inadequate coverage for repairs of DME (such as a
wheelchair) leaving respondents using defective equipment, thus limiting their mobility. For many, especially
people with spinal cord injuries, the wheelchair is their
mobilityÐwithout it their lives are severely restricted.
When a defective wheelchair does not get repaired in a
timely manner, their mobility and independence
becomes limited, and at times, even lost. `If you're going
to school, or if you have other things to do, which pretty
much everybody does, even if you're not working, it
takes a couple days away from your life because you
don't have your chair' says a 40-year-old female with
SCI.
Other respondents also had to curtail their social
interactions and were unable to participate in social
events because they were using inadequate wheelchairs
and were unable to obtain timely repairs. A defective
wheelchair `just limited my being able to go or do much
of anything at that time', says one 48-year-old respondent with SCI. Such was also the case with one 24-
year-old male with SCI who could not ` . . . go out
and socialize, get out and go places because it's so hard
to get that thing (the wheelchair) to fold up'.
Psychological
Respondents also reported issues that were categorised as `psychological consequences', to include
depression, frustration, stress and devaluation. The feeling of being useless also resulted from experiences with
`®ghting the system' or encountering access diculties.
A 52-year-old male study participant with SCI says,
`You get to where you feel useless, and you get to where
you really don't want to go on any further. You get tired
of ®ghting the system'.
Depression, frustration and stress. Respondents cited
feelings of depression, frustration, and stress as a consequence of barriers to health care. After he was told that
he would be unable to receive physical therapy services
for his MS, a 44-year-old male respondent commented
that `The biggest thing with me is the depression over
having no future, and I think that is more from my deteriorating due to not exercising or receiving physical therapy'.
Along with such experiences of depression, respondents often cited stress and frustration with the structure
of managed care plans and the referral process. `I'm in a
managed care plan, so to do anything you must go
through your primary care provider (PCP), and that is
one of the frustrations. If you can't see your PCP, you
don't have any other options'. (Female with SCI, 48-
years-old). A 30-year-old woman with MS concurs: `It
was also frustration that I couldn't refer myself'. When
another 37-year-old woman with MS was unable to see
her PCP, her `stress level doubled'. She went on to
explain that `I usually get extremely tired because of
the stress'.
Experiences of devaluation. Some respondents also felt
misunderstood and devalued by doctors who were
unable to provide for them and their needs in a timely
and knowledgeable manner. `If you go in, and she
(PCP) doesn't have the time of day for you, why go
through that entire hassle. And it was a big emotional
turmoil for me to go in and feel as though it was a total
waste of time, that I was being devalued, and that it
wasn't doing any good anyway', says a 44-year-old
female with MS. Because of this, she actually curtailed
her health care utilization: `A lot of times if there was
a medical problem, I would decide that it wasn't even
worth going in because it might not help . . . '
Even if provider oces were accessible, there was still
the issue of oce equipment accessibility, with nonaccessible equipment often making care for people with
disabilities more dicult. One 40-year-old woman with
SCI spoke of the awkwardness she felt during transfers
by untrained sta at oce visits:
The tables you must lie on for those are up so high
you couldn't dream of ¯ying up there. They are
just not accessible, and the only way to get up
there is to have people lift you. They make you feel
very awkward. I weigh about 130 pounds, and
they will bring ®ve people to lift me up on the table, and everyone starts pulling at your pants on
one leg. They think nothing of it. They think, `let's
throw her up there and strip her'.
The consequences of access barriers to health care
89
Physical
The most frequently noted physical consequences of
inappropriate access to health care services were made
in reference to a general deterioration in health. This
included the increased risk for secondary conditions,
as well as limitations in completing household chores
and maintaining personal hygiene.
Deterioration in health. As a result of inadequate
access to health care services, participants experienced
varying degrees of health-related deterioration, such as
muscular weakness, shoulder damage, and increased
risk for development of secondary conditions, such
as decubitus ulcers. For example, the inability to see
one's provider for a prescription caused a deterioration in health, `I went without medication that I
needed. Because of that, instead of getting better, I
was getting worse' (38-year-old woman with CP).
Inaccessible provider oces also meant that some
respondents would only see their PCP when it was
absolutely necessary, thus putting their health in
jeopardy:
I'd wait until an upper respiratory infection evolved
into pneumonia before I would go . . . I did not follow through with a course of treatment that my gynaecologist wanted me to have because it meant
going to the oce, minimally once a month for at
least six months, and there was no way. (44-yearold woman with MS)
The inability to obtain DME in a timely manner also
hampered mobility and caused injuries for a 53-year-old
man with MS, `If these rascals from Medicare had
approved a scooter or something for me, I wouldn't
have been falling all over and I wouldn't have bones that
are all out of place and have bursitis'. Delays in wheelchair repairs led to prolonged use of inappropriate
wheelchairs, which increased shoulder damage for many
respondents with SCI. For example, one 40-year-old
woman experienced `increased problems with the
shoulders, again because of overuse of having to wheel
around . . . that chair supports me in a dierent way
and creates problems with the muscles that aren't
supported'. Another man with SCI concurred: `As far
as not being able to get the wheelchair any quicker, I
was causing more damage to my shoulders'. And yet
another male respondent with SCI observed that as a
result of delayed repairs to his wheelchair, `I blew out
my shoulders . . . I'm getting (to) where I can't push a
manual chair anymore'.
Activity limitations. Respondents experienced limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) that prevented them
from carrying out household chores, and leisure activities. One 52-year-old female respondent with CP
pointed out that after she was unable to see her PCP,
`Things didn't get done that normally get done. I
couldn't stand and cook meals like I usually do and I
couldn't clean the house, stand and do dishes or things
like that'. A 43-year-old man with CP noted that due
to a lack of access to his provider, `My daily functioning
decreased throughout that time. I ended up having
another surgery . . . They said that could have been
avoided if other doctors would have attempted to look
at it (his leg)'. In addition, there were also reports of
diculty with personal hygiene. A middle-aged woman
with MS who experienced delays in obtaining DME
said, `All my activities of daily living are severely limited
because our shower is at the other end of the house, so
it's a real problem if I don't get the scooter'.
Economic
Financial strain and additional health service expenditures were other consequences of inappropriate access to
health care services. Deteriorating health and the development of secondary conditions sometimes necessitated
additional and more comprehensive services adding to
personal health care expenses, and straining economic
resources. This issue is exacerbated for those on limited
incomes, as the costs of using more health care services
can add up rather quickly.
Financial strain. Some participants had to miss work
as a consequence of their increased pain or deteriorating
health due to inappropriate health care service access.
Lost work time and decreased job productivity translated into economic hardship, as was the case with one
56-year-old man with CP, `If I'm in too much pain, I
can't go to work. It amounts to pinching pennies and
spending dollars instead'. For others, paying out of
pocket for supplies that are not covered by health insurance plans leads to economic hardship and ®nancial
strain. `Supplies, I have to buy . . . They (insurance)
don't buy a lot of that stu. I have to pay for it out of
the minimum wage . . . ' (49-year-old male with CP).
Additional health service expenditures. For some,
increased service utilization resulted from lack of timely
or appropriate access to certain health care services.
This was especially true with regard to physical therapy.
Some respondents did not obtain needed therapy for
M. T. Neri and T. Kroll

maintaining muscle strength and mobility because their
insurance would only pay for a limited number of physical therapy sessions. A middle-aged woman with MS
explained how her ®nancial situation would be impacted
if she was not going to be able to obtain needed physical
therapy: `If I don't get stronger . . . I have small children, so I might need someone to come in and help
him (her husband), and there's another expense'.
Another 51-year-old woman with SCI obtained only a
limited number of physical therapy visits, so when she
reached her limit, she paid for them on her own to
continue, thus exhausting her savings account and
straining her ®nances.
Independence issues
Respondents perceived a greater need to rely on
others for assistance as a result of not obtaining the
appropriate health care that would have allowed them
to continue to perform these activities on their own.
Traditional roles were challenged and they spoke of
experiencing a loss of independence and having to rely
more on spouses, children, colleagues, and friends for
assistance.
Greater dependency on others. Husbands helped wives
out of bed, children helped in tasks that were traditionally carried out by their parents (e.g. cooking and cleaning), and neighbours helped respondents enter their
homes. `I'm no longer able to push up the ramp into
my house. So I have to wait until a neighbour comes
home to get into the house . . . my life has really changed' (Male with SCI, 48, denied physical therapy visits).
The inability to obtain or repair DME in a timely
manner often led to a greater dependency on others.
One 29-year-old female with CP was unable to obtain
a new wheelchair, so she had to use her inadequate
back-up chair, which made her more dependent on
others: `It's more of a headache because I can't lift
and transfer the chair in and out of my car on my
own . . . I've had to use my cell phone and have coworkers come out of the building to drag my chair in
and out of my car. It totally kills any idea of true independence'.
One 36-year-old mother with MS found that after she
was unable to see her specialist, she had `to ask for a
little more help at home, with my son'. This loss of independence presented her with:
. . . uncomfortable situations, having to have my
son help me, things like that. It made me feel more
dependent, and I just hate that. I'm the mom; I'm
the one that you're depending on . . . it does bother me when I have to give up the independence and
have people help me. It's really a problem for me
because I'm the one that did all this before.
CONSEQUENCES OF ACCESS BARRIERS BY DISABILITY TYPE,
GENDER, AND HEALTH INSURANCE TYPE
The consequence domains were sorted by three demographic attributes, to include `disability type', `gender',
and `health insurance type'. Table 3 contains the
number of respondents organized by attributes who
observed consequences in the social, psychological,
physical, economic, and independence-related domains.
For 262 tables (i.e. consequence domains by gender
and health insurance type) Fisher's exact test (onetailed, alpha=0.05) was computed. Where small cell
sizes precluded a meaningful statistical analysis, visual
inspection of the data was used to highlight consistency,
variability and dierences in the data for each attribute.
Disability type
There was some variability across all three disability
groups in each consequence domain. Very little variation was found in the most frequently and the least
frequently noted domains, `physical consequences' and
`economic consequences', respectively. Variability was
greatest with regard to `independence-related issues',
closely followed by `social consequences'. Respondents
with MS were half as likely as CP respondents to report
`independence-related' consequences; SCI respondents
were more than three times as likely as people with CP
to state `social consequences'. Statistical analyses for

disability type were not conducted due to the small cell
sizes, and Fisher's exact test limitation to 262 tables.
Gender
The most frequently noted consequence domain was
`physical consequences'. More women reported consequences in this domain. Statistically signi®cant gender
dierences were found only for psychological consequences, with nearly four times as many women
(n=11) reporting consequences in this domain compared
to men (n=3) (p=0.012). No or little dierence was
found for `independence-related issues' and `social
consequences'. The least noted consequence domain
was `economic consequences', and four times as many
men reported consequences in this domain than women.
Health insurance type
In comparing enrolees in MC vs FFS health insurance
plans, the largest dierences were found for the consequence domain `psychological consequences'. Managed
care respondents were almost twice as likely to cite
psychological consequences than their FFS counterparts. However, this dierence was not statistically
signi®cant. There were no or small dierences between
FFS and MC enrolees in consequence domains other
than `psychological'. No statistically signi®cant dierences between MC and FFS were found for any of the
consequence domains.
THREE CASE STUDIES
Barriers rarely produced just a single consequence.
Far more frequently the aforementioned consequences
showed complex interactions with far-reaching implications for many areas of respondents' lives. In some cases
several simultaneous consequences resulted from one
distinct barrier to care, while in other cases consequences showed a `sequential eect' with one consequence leading to another.
A combination of barriers to care sometimes led to an
interaction among the consequences experienced. For
example, one 52-year-old man with a spinal cord injury
was publicly insured through Medicare (see ®gure 1),
which would not cover the costs of a new power chair
because he was only covered for new DME once every
®ve years, and he could not aord one on his limited
income. As a consequence, he had to continue to use
his manual wheelchair, which caused more damage to
his already arthritic shoulders. As a result of his
increased shoulder damage, he was then unable to care
for his legs: `I can't straighten them out any more all
the way . . . I couldn't work my legs because it hurt

consequences.

92
(my shoulders) so bad to reach down and pull them up,
to bend them . . . that all goes back to the wheelchair
problem'.
The shoulder deterioration also led to increased
service utilization, namely physical therapy, to strengthen his arms and shoulders so that he could continue to
use his existing manual chair. However, it turned out
that it was too late for physical therapy to remedy his
shoulder deterioration. This had detrimental consequences for his independence. `They've (shoulders)
gotten to a point now to where that is creating a
problem with transferring. If I could have gotten it
(physical therapy) done earlier, there's a great possibility
this problem could have been helped'. In turn, all of this
caused him great concern for his future and ability to
live alone and independently:
What's going to happen now is it's just shortening
the time I'm going to be able to live by myself. I'm
going to have to go into a nursing home eventually, but a lot quicker. It has probably cut three
to ®ve years o of it. I'll be lucky if I can stay by
myself, say, another three, four years.
Thus, the consequences from barriers to accessing
health care for this respondent were far-reaching and
complex. The physical deterioration contributed to his
decreased independence, as he was beginning to experience problems with transferring. Together, the interrelatedness of the physical and independence consequences led him to believe that his current lifestyle was
in jeopardy, and that he would need nursing home care
much sooner than he anticipated.
A 44-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis reported
inter-related consequences that stemmed from inaccessible facilities (see ®gure 2). The parking lots of provider
oces were on a steep incline so that `when you park,
you then have to go up a hill . . . It just can't be done.
I'd have to . . . just sit there and rest my arms . . . and
I was desperately ®ghting for a power chair for years'.
This was very upsetting for her and consequently, she
decided to delay preventive care that was needed so that
she would not have to deal with the mental and physical
fatigue of the parking lot situation. `It was so upsetting,
the thought of even having to go (to her provider) was
so distressing! I thought, `screw it!' If I'm not going to
die, if nothing horrible is happening to me, never mind!'
The inaccessibility of the parking lot jeopardised her
health care, and may continue to do so.
The physical strain of using a manual chair also had
consequences for her social life as her community involvement became more limited:
I don't do as much. I ®nd myself having to miss
out on things . . . there are things that I need to
do, there are places I need to go. I can't get there
. . . When I see that there's going to be something
happening somewhere, and I know that the accessibility is a serious question, if I had a power chair,
I could go up that hill. I might be able to make
that ramp . . . I can't do that (with a manual
chair).
For this woman, the physical consequences were
inter-related with the social consequences that she
experienced in that they contributed to limitations in
her social life. She was no longer strong enough to
manoeuvre her manual chair, which limited her social
life and options.
Our last case study (see ®gure 3) illustrates the interrelated consequences of inappropriate access for a
woman with cerebral palsy. As a result of delayed physical therapy services, her overall condition declined
which limited her mobility and caused her to become
more dependent on her husband and assistive devices:
`A lot of my mobility was cut down, and I couldn't do
the things I normally do. My husband would have to
help me out of bed'. She had to start using a cane to
assist her with her walking and was unable to perform
daily housekeeping tasks, so her family had to assist
her with them. Although her declining condition initially
only aected her physical mobility, in the long-term it
also aected her ability to care for herself independently
and be productive in her home.
There were also psychological consequences in that
she felt misunderstood by those who were not knowledgeable about CP and her limited mobility:
Figure 2 Case description of a 44-year-old woman with multiple
sclerosis. Shaded object indicates barrier, un-shaded objects indicate
consequences.
The consequences of access barriers to health care
93
I think people need a better understanding of what
cerebral palsy is. We're not stupid people just because our bodies don't work right; our minds do.
We can still be productive and useful citizens. Just
because we have a disability doesn't mean that
we're broken.
These three case studies illustrate how the consequences experienced by our respondents can be interrelated and far-reaching. Inappropriate, untimely, and
inaccessible health care services are some of the barriers
that can lead to these social, psychological, physical,
economic, and independence related consequences for
adults with disabilities.
Discussion
Study participants identi®ed a diverse set of consequences as a result of access barriers to health care
services. Our research was able to contextualise these
consequences in respect to the social, psychological,
physical, economic, and independent lives of our
respondents.
Physical consequences were cited most often by our
respondents, regardless of disability type, gender, or
health insurance type. This is consistent with ®ndings
from a recent quantitative study on barriers to accessing
health care among people with disabilities.23 As noted
previously, physical consequences were often the result
of delays in obtaining DME and/or rehabilitative therapies. Therefore, it is possible that the detrimental physical consequences (e.g. secondary conditions, such as
pressure sores, and functional decline) experienced by
our respondents could have been prevented with the
appropriate delivery of DME and rehabilitative therapies, including maintenance therapy. Unfortunately,
most health insurance plans in the USA do not cover
maintenance therapies that, in essence, ensure independent living, and only cover those therapies that restore
or improve function. In addition, coverage for DME is
often limited to a predetermined number of visits over
a certain time period (e.g. 20 visits over a year) or to a
set dollar amount. This means that people with disabilities may not always be able to receive these services
when they need them, or to the extent that they need
them. As shown, the lack of maintenance therapies
and DME can lead to harmful consequences that may
not be fully understood by health care providers and
health insurance plans.
In this comparison of consequence domains by the
demographic attributes of disability type, gender, and
health insurance type, a heterogeneous picture has been
found. There was substantial variability in the types of
consequences that were reported by each of the three
disability groups, especially for social and independence-related consequences. It is unclear what lies
behind these dierences. This may re¯ect dierences in
the degree of the mobility impairment across the three
Figure 3 Case description of a 52-year-old woman with cerebral palsy. Shaded object indicates barrier, un-shaded objects indicate consequences.
M. T. Neri and T. Kroll
94
disability types, as well as the variability of disability
presentation and severity. The small cell sizes may have
also produced random variability. A statistical analysis
was not possible since the minimum requirements for
cell and table size were not met.
The results also point to gender dierences in the
reporting of the consequences of barriers to health care.
While women reported more psychological consequences (such as frustration) as a result of inappropriate
access, men stressed economic consequences more often
than women did. This gender dierence for psychological consequences was statistically signi®cant, yet for
economic consequences it was not. Further research
would be needed to determine whether the tendency of
women to report more psychological consequences is
the result of dierences in the experience of access
problems or rather a greater frankness among women
to report such psychological concerns. Frustration with
various access to care barriers was also reported as a
major consequence in another qualitative study, albeit
a gender dierence was not reported.24
Similarly, it is not known why four times as many
men as women reported economic consequences. On
the one hand, it is possible that men are more likely to
frame personal consequences in economic terms, keeping with traditional male role expectations. On the other
hand, our sample was comprised of twice as many men
(n=10) than women (n=5) who had a household
income of less than $20 000, which points to true
economic dierences and need. Moreover, our male
respondents were more likely to be single (i.e. divorced,
not married, or widowed), perhaps indicating economic
hardship by living o a single income, with the additional possibility of child support payments for those
who are divorced.
Finally, no statistically signi®cant dierences between
respondents in MC plans compared to those covered by
FFS plans in any of the consequence domains were
found. However, a few observations can be made regardless of statistical signi®cance. Almost twice as many MC
enrolees experienced psychological consequences as a
result from denied access than their FFS counterparts.
If replicable in a larger sample this ®nding may re¯ect
some of the diculties people with disabilities in MC
plans face in accessing specialist care and downstream
services (e.g. rehabilitative therapies), areas of care that
are typically restricted in MC plans. The psychological
impact of denied care and services may prove costly in
the long-term. As our research has shown, frustration,
anger, and depression may weaken the individual's motivation to seek care, to adhere to treatment regimens, and
to initiate necessary preventive strategies.
Our three case descriptions showed how access
barriers to health care services can produce multiple
consequences at any given point in time. The inter-relatedness of these consequences experienced by our respondents was quite surprising in that so many consequences
could be borne from one or two access barriers and have
multiple eects on the respondent's life. Obstacles to
timely and appropriate services may set in motion a
sequence of various consequences that emerge and
develop over time, adding to their impact on the individual in terms of harmful and irreversible eects.
The convenience character of the sample which was
based on a larger, national study population that was
not necessarily representative of people with disabilities
in the USA is also recognised. This study focused on
adults with SCI, CP, or MS and thus may not re¯ect
the experiences of other disability groups. Moreover,
the sample was composed of individuals who all stated
that they had experienced diculties with accessing
needed health care services in at least three out of ®ve
service areas. This subset was chosen based on the wish
to explore the consequences related to these barriers in
the greatest possible depth. The qualitative methodology
does not claim that these results will be generalizable25 to
all people with disabilities. Rather, our ®ndings illustrate the complex ways that multiple access barriers
and their consequences impact the lives of adults with
disabilities.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the ®ndings point to implications for
the delivery of health care for adults with disabilities.
Appropriate and timely access to health care services
is the only way to reduce the barriers that lead to the
consequences discussed in this paper. In this vein, more
health care providers and insurance plans must become
`disability literate' in order to treat adults with disabilities more eectively and to reduce the barriers they
encounter. This involves an enhanced skill set, as well
as an increased sensitivity to and understanding of the
variable needs of people with disabilities. Greater
disability literacy would provide people with disabilities
with more appropriate care in that providers would
recognize their need for timely services and referrals.
The successful implementation of disability literate
health insurance plans would also oer adequate coverage for maintenance and rehabilitative therapies, as well
as DME. In the USA most cost saving eorts focus on
the acute health care needs of the average health care
consumer. Coverage for services is typically limited to
those that restore or improve function. However, people
The consequences of access barriers to health care
95
with disabilities need services that help them to maintain
function and to prevent complications, functional
decline, and secondary conditions. As our case studies
have shown, these `cost-saving models' of health care
delivery can `back®re', and increase the need for even
more expensive services and lead to harmful consequences in the long-term.
In the USA, progress is being made towards the
reduction of some of the environmental barriers (e.g.
building accessibility) cited as the cause of some of our
respondents' consequences. The Healthy People 2010
initiative in the USA26 calls for the reduction of barriers
in homes, schools, work places, and other community
settings. It remains to be seen whether these eorts will
also result in more accessible provider oces and diagnostic equipment. At the very least, national initiatives
like Healthy People 2010 will raise awareness of disparities in health care access for people with disabilities.
Along with the awareness building for accessibility
issues, it is also necessary to promote eorts that target
the provider and health insurance communities to
enhance disability literacy. This will be an important
step towards minimising the occurrence and severity of
the consequences experienced by adults with disabilities.
